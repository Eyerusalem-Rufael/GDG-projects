Project 1: Demonstrates how to initialize a project, install dependencies like axios (for HTTP requests) and nodemon (for auto-reloading), and create custom scripts to fetch data from a public API.


Project 2: Shows how to use the lodash library to find the maximum and minimum numbers in an array, update and uninstall dependencies, and automate tasks with npm scripts.


project 3: This project shows a simple Node.js HTTP server that handles basic API requests. It includes a GET endpoint (`/hello`) that responds with a "Hello, world!" message and a POST endpoint (`/data`) that accepts JSON input and returns the received data. The server listens on port 4000 and provides a basic structure for handling HTTP requests using Node.js's built-in `http` module. It also includes error handling for undefined routes, responding with a "404 Not Found" message. This project is ideal for understanding fundamental server-side request handling in Node.js without external dependencies.

Project 4: This project demonstrates a simple Node.js HTTP server that manages a list of users with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The server provides endpoints to retrieve all users (GET /users), add a new user (POST /users), update an existing user (PUT /users/:id), and delete a user (DELETE /users/:id). It listens on port 4000 and processes requests using Node.js's built-in http module without external dependencies. This project serves as a foundational example for handling API requests and managing data in a server-side environment.
